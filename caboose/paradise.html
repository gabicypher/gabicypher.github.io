          <h1>The Caboose contains: Paradise</h1>
          <p>You found it.</p>
          <p>Oh. Hi. Welcome to Paradise! I haven’t quite finished making it yet. I’m not one of those fancy new-age gods who can make a whole world in just a week. It takes some time, okay?</p>
          <p>I’m really interested in depictions of paradise, of utopias, of places that maybe used to be paradises in the past. I’ve got a few different pieces that are going to make up my paradise, once I get around to actually doing all the art:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>The Como Conservatory in St. Paul, Minnesota, specifically the big glass greenhouses where my grandma used to take me as a kid. It’s like stepping into another world, out of the cold, biting wind and into some sort of lush, tropical island. The air there is so heavy that you almost can’t breathe.</li>
            <li>One of those modern museum gift shops, with the gentle music and tasteful artistic design and smooth, circular architecture. The pins glitter under the spotlights. There’s a mirror where you can take selfies with your friends. The tote bags are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>The uncle’s tower in The Boy and the Heron. Or that field of flowers in Howl’s Moving Castle, or Laputa from The Castle in the Sky. I like Studio Ghibli and I like paradises that are a little bit false.</li>
            <li>This one lamp store on Pearl Street, in Boulder, Colorado. I feel like a small moth inside of there, entranced by the flickering, multicolored lights, pulled deeper through Turkish rugs and hand-painted bowls and glass mosaics, dripping like molasses across the floor, caught in the pull of the light.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Basically Paradise is very real to me and it’s just gonna take a while to do all the painting and the planning and the coding and refining the trajectories of the birds that have to fly overhead.</p>
          <p>And there’s a secret hidden at the heart of Paradise, because nothing is worth anything if there’s not something to discover. It is simultaneously my greatest secret, my greatest shame, and my most keenly-felt regret (I don’t usually deal in the business of regret).</p>
          <p>It’s like this tweet, okay? (This is one of my favorite tweets of all time):</p>

          <div class="doubleimage">
            <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabicypher/gabicypher.github.io/refs/heads/main/media/my-only-secret.jpg" alt="Tweet by superhotawesome that reads: in jr high i liked this girl i was best friends with so much that i was miserable & one day i couldnt take it anymore so i made a new minecraft world called 'my only secret' where the seed was her name, wrote 'i like her'in a book & buried it in a chest in the middle of the ocean">

          </div>

          <p>You have to write your only secret down somewhere, and I only use Minecraft to play Minecraft Horse Simulator (it’s like Minecraft but you only care about the horses) so I had to put it in Paradise instead.</p>
          
          <p id="my-only-secret" style="cursor: pointer;">My Only Secret:</p>

          <script>
            // Select button by ID
            const myOnlySecret = document.getElementById('my-only-secret');
            // Add listener for button click
            myOnlySecret.addEventListener('click', function () {
              // Replace My Only Secret's value with the secret
              myOnlySecret.innerText = "My Only Secret: One day when I was in highschool everybody had to bring in their favorite song and write it on a piece of paper and drop it in a hat and the teacher would pick a song out at random and play it for the whole class and everybody had to guess whose favorite song it was and then you’d explain what it meant to you except I was 16 years old and I was so scared of everything, of anyone understanding me as a person, afraid of them seeing through me, that I lied about what my favorite song was I said it was Something Just Like This by Coldplay and the Chainsmokers and when it was played aloud no one could guess whose song it was and the teacher said gabi why’s that your favorite song and I just said oh I heard it on the radio last week and I liked it BUT I WAS LYING IT WAS ALL A LIE I sat there congratulating myself on being the coolest, most nonchalant person in the class and I wish I had just told the truth I wish I’d had the confidence to tell everybody that my favorite song was Fireflies by Owl City."
