          <h1>Website Development</h1>
          <h2>What even is this website?</h2>
          <p>I made this website entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>. I originally hosted on <a href="https://neocities.org/" target="_blank">Neocities</a>, but switched over to GitHub Pages when adding my custom domain name.</p>
          
          <h2>Useful Sources</h2>
          <p>The chatbox on the home page was created by <a href="https://virtualobserver.moe/ayano/comment-widget" target="_blank">Virtual Observer</a>. It's actually just a reskinned Google Form that displays responses as comments--neat!</p>
          
          <p>The contact page form runs through <a href="https://formsubmit.co/" target="_blank">FormSubmit</a>. Responses are sent directly to my email address.</p>
          
          <p>The home page music player was based on code made by <a href="https://odditycommoddity.neocities.org/" target="_blank">Oddity Commodity</a>, a fellow Neocities user (I highly recommend checking out their website). I modified this base code pretty heavily, so let me know if you have any questions about what's going on.</p>
          
          <p><a href="https://tholman.com/" target="_blank">Tim Holman</a> created <a href="https://github.com/tholman/cursor-effects" target="_blank">this excellent project</a>: a set of cursors with unique trailing effects. I'm using the emojis trail option on this website, with an equal chance for the cursor to drop any of the following: :3 :D >:) ❤️ 💛 🎨 💥 💫 🪐 ⭐ ✨ ⚡️ 🌈 ☀️</p>
  
          <p>I mostly learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by messing around, trying things out, and googling questions. The most helpful resource by far has been the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">W3 Schools</a> tutorials. I definitely recommend starting there if you're new to website building.</p>
  
          <h2>Website Vision</h2>
                  
          <p>Eventually I want this website to be an all-around homepage for me, with both a professional side where everyone can check out my projects in optics, biophysics, engineering, and programming, as well as a casual side of the site for my art and writing projects.</p>
        
          <h2>But those are all big dreams... What's actually gonna happen on this website in the near future?</h2>

          <ol>
            <li>Add the Stentor project.</li>
            <li>Add an option to turn off the cursor emoji trail (and other accessibility options?)</li>
            <li>Set up project tag navigation.</li>
            <li>Improve the favicon.</li>
            <li>Make things look better: choose fonts for real, fix up the sticky boxes.</li>
            <li>Replace the temporary header with a real one. Maybe incorporate some animation. Create a smaller version for the sub-pages.</li>
            <li>Add small animations–the header moves when you hover over it. Hovering over links makes them wobble on the Projects page.</li>
            <li>Add a select-a-font box on the main page right bar.</li>
            <li>Add a “you are the nth visitor” box on the right bar.</li>
            <li>Add buttons to get to my friends’ websites.</li>
            <li>Add a button where you have to input a password that takes you to the friends side of the site–the only difference is that there’s also a tab that has my Telegram channel embedded.</li>
            <li>Fix the way the website compresses with half-screens and mobile displays. Maybe check in on the large computer design too.</li>
            <li>With everything accomplished (as if), go check out other cool websites on the Internet and see if I can find anything to incorporate. There's always new things to do!!!</li>
